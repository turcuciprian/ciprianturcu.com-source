<p>It really has been a while since I last wrote anything here. I've been busy lately and I wanted to give a quick update on what's been going on.</p>
<p>I moved on from Wordpress about a year ago, but oficially, only about 2 weeks ago when I gave the rights to one of my most popular plugins to someone else. Now, what about AngularJs and everything else I've been doing? I moved on to react more than a year ago, and stuck with it. I really really like it now, would not go back for anything.</p>
<p>I plan on creating tutorials in react and related things here, going forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was just a short update of what is to come. Very short, not complete though, I have other plans but for the moment I would keep these a secret. stay tuned.</p>
