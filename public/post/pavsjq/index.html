<h5 id="angular-2">Angular 2</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m new in angular 2. I made a project for about most of last year in Angular 1.5.x and started learning Angular 2 in the past month.
First I did the angular tour of heroes tutorial on the official site. Kind of got stuck on the services part. I wanted to understand everything and things where not making so much sense so I moved on to other prospect tutorials. A very good friend of mine gave me as a birthday present a uDemy course, about angular 2. So I started from the versy first lesson, and I made each step with the IDE open and trying everything in my right. I wanted to remember everything, try out and understand completely. That worked, but, it was slow as hell. In after completing a 10% part of a 35h course I started just listening to the courses for the next 10%. at 20% I only started to look for the parts that where crucial in my head and needed to know about, that I was about to use. What was left in my head was routing, http and dependency injection.</p>

<p>I loved routing, how it was done in Angular 2, just loved it. Everything was so simple, it made sense.HTTP, not so much and dependency injection I did not quite get.</p>

<h3 id="jquery">jQuery</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with jQuery for about 10 years. It&rsquo;s been a love-hate relationship but more love, like 85% love, 15% hate. Hate in the first years when things did not work. It was usually (mostly) my fault when that happened. but in jQuery, like, I think most of everybody else that&rsquo;s a 10+ year front end (or full stack) developer, I was and am, more in control of, more comfortable with.</p>

<h3 id="the-project">The project</h3>

<p>The project was simple. A webpage where you get to put something in a textbox on mobile and then have it on any other place (desktop mostly). A web based app that allows any user to share anything at any given time.</p>

<p>It took me 1.5 weeks to fail in doing it with angular 2 and about 3-5 hours to do it from scratch with jQuery, Bootstrap and both a goLang rest server and firebase database.</p>

<h3 id="the-result">The result</h3>

<p>At <a href="http://toolaxy.com/paste">http://toolaxy.com/paste</a> you can find the project. The html, css, js are hosted on github pages and the database is firebase. Basically it&rsquo;s a fully functional web app that&rsquo;s simple as hell, and that&rsquo;s also free.</p>

<p>At one point things where too complicated in Angular 2 to make and a CRAZY idea struck my mind. Why not do it in jQuery, you&rsquo;re much more comfortable with it, and it does not have to be a complex functionality. Well, originally I was looking to learn Angular 2 (that&rsquo;s why I made it originally in angular), I was looking to learn golang. But in the end, all that I was left with was the realization that angular 2 was not the best choice for this project. And it made me question, what kind of project is angular 2 good for. Still don&rsquo;t have the answer to that. Same problem in my head with React. At most, if I do have a reason for building something specifically like that, with string interpolation, data binding, directives, models, routes and other angular-like features, I would use vuejs. It seems to have everything, support and covers most of the things one might need. First, there must be a reason for using it.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>jQuery is ranking better than angular and react and vuejs combined on google trends. But that&rsquo;s not the reason.
jQuery is older and more documented online than anguar and react and vuejs combined (I&rsquo;m talking stack overflow, forums, projects, etc). But that&rsquo;s not the reason either.
jQuery is the fastest, easiest, most reliable way for me to get to a result in a web app compared to any other alternative, mostly because it was part of my life for the past 10 years of front end development. And that is the reason. I&rsquo;m more knowledgeable in jQuery, I am more capable of getting the job done. Period.</p>
