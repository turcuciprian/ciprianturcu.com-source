A very good friend of mine gave me as a birthday present a uDemy course, about angular 2.

That worked, but, it was slow as hell.

It’s been a love-hate relationship but more love, like 85% love, 15% hate. Hate in the first years when things did not work.

A webpage where you get to put something in a textbox on mobile and then have it on any other place (desktop mostly). A web based app that allows any user to share anything at any given time.</p>\\n<p>It took me 1.5 weeks to fail in doing it with angular 2 and about 3-5 hours to do it from scratch with jQuery, Bootstrap and both a goLang rest server and firebase database.</p>\\n<h3>The result</h3>\\n<p>At <a href=\\\"http://toolaxy.com/paste\\\">http://toolaxy.com/paste</a> you can find the project. The html, css, js are hosted on github pages and the database is firebase. Basically it’s a fully functional web app that’s simple as hell, and that’s also free.</p>\\n<p>At one point things where too complicated in Angular 2 to make and a CRAZY idea struck my mind. Why not do it in jQuery, you’re much more comfortable with it, and it does not have to be a complex functionality. Well, originally I was looking to learn Angular 2 (that’s why I made it originally in angular), I was looking to learn golang. But in the end, all that I was left with was the realization that angular 2 was not the best choice for this project. And it made me question, what kind of project is angular 2 good for. Still don’t have the answer to that. Same problem in my head with React. At most, if I do have a reason for building something specifically like that, with string interpolation, data binding, directives, models, routes and other angular-like features, I would use vuejs. It seems to have everything, support and covers most of the things one might need.
