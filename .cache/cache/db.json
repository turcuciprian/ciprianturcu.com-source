I made a project for about most of last year in Angular 1.5.x and started learning Angular 2 in the past month.\nFirst I did the angular tour of heroes tutorial on the official site. Kind of got stuck on the services part. I wanted to understand everything and things where not making so much sense so I moved on to other prospect tutorials. A very good friend of mine gave me as a birthday present a uDemy course, about angular 2. So I started from the versy first lesson, and I made each step with the IDE open and trying everything in my right. I wanted to remember everything, try out and understand completely. That worked, but, it was slow as hell. In after completing a 10% part of a 35h course I started just listening to the courses for the next 10%. at 20% I only started to look for the parts that where crucial in my head and needed to know about, that I was about to use. What was left in my head was routing, http and dependency injection.</p>\n<p>I loved routing, how it was done in Angular 2, just loved it. Everything was so simple, it made sense.HTTP, not so much and dependency injection I did not quite get.</p>\n<h3>jQuery</h3>\n<p>I’ve been working with jQuery for about 10 years. It’s been a love-hate relationship but more love, like 85% love, 15% hate. Hate in the first years when things did not work. It was usually (mostly) my fault when that happened. but in jQuery, like, I think most of everybody else that’s a 10+ year front end (or full stack) developer, I was and am, more in control of, more comfortable with.</p>\n<h3>The project</h3>\n<p>The project was simple. A webpage where you get to put something in a textbox on mobile and then have it on any other place (desktop mostly). A web based app that allows any user to share anything at any given time.</p>\n<p>It took me 1.5 weeks to fail in doing it with angular 2 and about 3-5 hours to do it from scratch with jQuery, Bootstrap and both a goLang rest server and firebase database.</p>\n<h3>The result</h3>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://toolaxy.com/paste\">http://toolaxy.com/paste</a> you can find the project. The html, css, js are hosted on github pages and the database is firebase. Basically it’s a fully functional web app that’s simple as hell, and that’s also free.</p>\n<p>At one point things where too complicated in Angular 2 to make and a CRAZY idea struck my mind. Why not do it in jQuery, you’re much more comfortable with it, and it does not have to be a complex functionality. Well, originally I was looking to learn Angular 2 (that’s why I made it originally in angular), I was looking to learn golang. But in the end, all that I was left with was the realization that angular 2 was not the best choice for this project. And it made me question, what kind of project is angular 2 good for.

It seems to have everything, support and covers most of the things one might need. First, there must be a reason for using it.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>jQuery is ranking better than angular and react and vuejs combined on google trends. But that’s not the reason.\njQuery is older and more documented online than anguar and react and vuejs combined (I’m talking stack overflow, forums, projects, etc). But that’s not the reason either.\njQuery is the fastest, easiest, most reliable way for me to get to a result in a web app compared to any other alternative, mostly because it was part of my life for the past 10 years of front end development.

A very good friend of mine gave me as a birthday present a uDemy course, about angular 2. So I started from the versy first lesson, and I made each step with the IDE open and trying everything in my right. I wanted to remember everything, try out and understand completely.

Somebody at one point came with the idea that they should release it to the public and make it open source. All the nerds had an orgasm when that happened, saw it as the greatest thing since sliced bread and adopted it blindly. A different batch of nerds had orgasms when Facebook released their in-house javascript library. But yeah, that happened too. What angular and react are can be defined as in-house libraries, created specifically , originally for their (google and Facebook’s) needs to the future products and services, to make things organized, standardized and simple. For them. That is all, nothing else. Now the IT world is trying to use the libraries for their needs. If the same approach and vision is applied, that will most likely work. If they are doing similar types of projects. Otherwise, it won’t work. Please prove me wrong.</p>\n<p>Alright, that was the last rand about angular and react, from me. But this post is not about angular and react, it’s about my progress, so let’s get to that, shall we?</p>\n<p>*** Seriously, what?</p>\n<p>In short, I’m learning Swift and iOS development. I left all the web stuff behind. No longer want to see WordPress, javascript, php, CSS, LESS, Gulp, HTML, MYSQL. That’s behind me now. It’s like a old girlfriend that I had a long lasting relationship with and now just broke up. It’s Important and healthy to move on as fast as possible. Especially if the relationship was not going that well at the end, and after you broke up with her, you hear she really got on a weird/bad path. The girlfriend in this case is the Web Development. That will make sense in a few years.</p>\n<p>*** SWIFT?</p>\n<p>Yeah, swift. I understand how I can make useful apps that will actually be capable to solve real life problems if I build them for the iPhone. xCode is awesome, SWIFT is awesome, right now I’m still learning it and basic principles in it,, core data, MVC, about IBOutlets and IBActions, how classes work and are inherited, how everything ties together. The emulator is great, I get to test any app that I make for real on my iPhone SE and I’m going to soon opt in to register a developer account (a paying one) on the app store.</p>\n<p>I have an app in mind, that I’m not going to talk about yet, that I want to make, launch, monetize and see how it goes.</p>\n<p>*** Challenging myself</p>\n<p>I made a self challenge to make at least 20 commits for 1 week on github, on my account (here <a href=\"https://github.com/turcuciprian\">https://github.com/turcuciprian</a> ) while developing in swift. You can see I have done that and I’m still doing it right now. However. 20 is not enough, I think I’m going to do 100 / day minimum, very soon. The reasoning behind the quantity approach is that I am forced to work a lot, to make that many commits. 20 was doable and not that hard. I think 100 is going to take much more of my time, I will get to work a lot, learn a lot and accomplish a lot. Not sure when I will be starting the 100 / day min. But it will be in the next few days.</p>\n<p>Obviously I won’t be a able to keep that up for too much time. But the challenge will be 100 commits / day minimum for 1 week. After I complete that challenge I’ll see what else I can challenge myself with. I’ll try to write about it here, just to keep a log of things. I’m tripling down on focus for the next period, focus and long and hard work. Nothing else, no distractions. So please, for the time being, leave me alone. See you in a while.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-a75d0585e90b2f9e4736e28584e7c602-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Paste Project - Angular vs jQuery\ndate: \"2017-03-31T23:25:10+03:00\"\nlayout: post\ndraft: false\npath: \"/posts/paste-project-angular-vs-jquery\"\ncategory: \"javascript\"\ntags:\n  - \"Angular\"\n  - \"jQuery\"\n  - \"fight\"\ndescription: \"Angular 2.x or jquery 3.x\"","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":13,"column":4,"offset":264},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"html","value":"<p>asd</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">some title </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;## asd</p>","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1,"offset":267},"end":{"line":18,"column":20,"offset":354},"indent":[1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":19,"column":1,"offset":355}}}},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-ast-a75d0585e90b2f9e4736e28584e7c602-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"raw","value":"<p>asd</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">some title </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;## asd</p>","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1,"offset":267},"end":{"line":18,"column":20,"offset":354}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":19,"column":1,"offset":355}}}},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-a75d0585e90b2f9e4736e28584e7c602-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants-","value":"<p>asd</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">some title </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;## asd</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-a5b37a438fc962443ebadecc7915aab5-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: \"It's been a while\"\nexcerpt: \"Latest update. 2018!\"\nauthor: \"Ciprian Turcu\"\ndate: \"2018-06-29T07:00:18.716Z\"\ndraft: false\nlayout: \"post\"\nfeaturedImage: \"\"\ntags: \n    - back\n    - updates\n    - going forwar","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":13,"column":4,"offset":220},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"html","value":"<p>It really has been a while since I last wrote anything here.
